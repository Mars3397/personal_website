# Blockchain Security Experience

## Full-Stack Software Engineer
**Taipei, Taiwan | 2021 - Present**

Developing eDetector, a forensics system capable of tracing virus invasion events across thousands of hosts.

### Responsibilities & Achievements

As a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Blockchain Security, I've been deeply involved in developing cutting-edge security solutions that help organizations detect and respond to cyber threats. Our flagship product, eDetector, has become an essential tool for forensics investigators across various industries.

#### Leadership & Project Management
- Promoted to team leader after one year, responsible for ensuring delivery of both local and cloud versions of the eDetector system for clients
- Led cross-functional teams to meet client requirements and deadlines
- Implemented agile methodologies to improve team productivity and product delivery

#### Technical Achievements
- Developed a high-concurrency server in Golang, utilizing goroutines and channels to process and analyze data collected simultaneously from over 1000 hosts
- Optimized version 1 of the system through structural refinement, parallel computing mechanisms, and data transmission protocol improvements, boosted processing efficiency by 500%
- Implemented a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment and testing on AWS, simplifying the development process, reducing testing time, and increasing product integrity

#### Data Engineering & Analytics
- Leveraged Elasticsearch to retrieve data in real-time and aggregate information from millions of documents
- Designed and implemented data visualization components to present complex security analyses in an understandable format
- Created analytics pipelines that process terabytes of security logs to identify potential threats

#### Frontend Development
- Integrated React libraries and packages including MUI, react-globe.gl to craft a user interface for displaying host information, enabling forensics investigators to identify virus invasions within a 10-minute timeframe
- Built responsive dashboards that adapt to various screen sizes and devices
- Implemented real-time data visualization components that update as new security data becomes available

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Golang, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Material-UI
- **Data**: Elasticsearch, Redis, PostgreSQL
- **DevOps**: CI/CD pipelines, Terraform, AWS CloudFormation

### Impact
The eDetector system has been deployed to numerous clients, helping security teams quickly identify and remediate security breaches. The system's efficiency improvements have allowed our clients to reduce their mean time to detect (MTTD) security incidents by an average of 60%, significantly reducing potential damage from cyber attacks.
